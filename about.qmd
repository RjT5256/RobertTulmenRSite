## Welcome to my page!  
I'm currently working part-time for UTD as a student worker for the OIT department, I use my data analytics skills gained from my studies to produce visualizations for our social media sites to drive funding decisions and I also do part-time property management for a building in Highland Park - alongside my masters education here at UTD of course. I love technology, watching movies, and I live with two cats named Archimedes and Scout.
