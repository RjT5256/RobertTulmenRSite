title: "External Drone Auditing"
---

I wanted to combine what I'd learned with the power of the DJI Mini 3 Pro. Although my drone has no imaging capabilities (other than stunning 4K video at 30 frames a second...) in combination with owning an Apple phone, meant I had to do everything myself manually. I had to designate my own flight path, tie points, and determine how many photos were enough to get an accurate 3D model to assess exterior damage... which I called an external audit.

Because of the rising costs in our everyday lives given Trump’s tariff era, I decided to focus my attention to homeowners in the DFW area. As you already might know my parents own this property in Highland Park, what you might not already know is that this area sees a lot of draft coming from the alley placed behind it. Given this information we receive a lot of wind damage to our composition shingles (more known as asphalt shingles). Roofing repairs used to cost us around 500 dollars a visit from our previous installer but given the rising rates due to tariffs (I know this because in the email we get from our roofer there is a disclaimer at the bottom to let you know that tariffs might affect pricing. We received a quote from the same employer for around 1800 making that a 260% increase from 500. Installing a new roof isn’t an option for us as we have new tenants moving in soon and we don’t possess the temporal equity to be able to move forward with that big an endeavor.

These shingles contain toxic metals such as Manganese, Copper, Zinc, Lead, and other harmful chemicals not to mention the petroleum and oil that goes into making these items for commercial usage. Another issue with this method of roofing is the breakdown of the chemical links between the products that make up these shingles from UV rays (the sun). As they breakdown they start to loosen and lose their integrity with the nails and eventually fall off. In tandem with rainwater leaking into the roof, you also see the PH levels rise in the coming days where rainfall is observed (Check out this study: Roofing as a source of non point water pollution – Science Direct). As a result, there is bio accumulation of lead and copper which are both toxic to the environment. And in particular, “However, mean Mn2+ concentrations in runoff from wood and composition shingle roofs were found to be significantly greater than in runoff from painted aluminum or galvanized roofs. (Which at higher quantities can be toxic to the environment)”. According to this roofing website: The Most Popular Roofing Materials in DFW | Dallas Roofing Experts, asphalt shingles are some of the most common roofing methods in the DFW metropolex which renders a concerning idea that we are polluting the environment whether we like it or not.

My goal with this project is to see if I can generate 3D models simply using a camera drone that isn’t necessarily built for jobs of this nature. With the growing interest in UASs I believe soon they will be akin to phones; in that they will be a necessity to keep up with modern technology. According to this site, Drone Market Size 2020-2025 | Drone Industry Insights written by an aerospace engineer, the drone market has increased by nearly 23 billion dollars since 2020 and is only going to go higher. With this significant growth we are going to see drones become more and more a part of our daily lives, including this masterful piece of machinery: Facility Inspection - Oil and Gas - Inspection - DJI Enterprise. Like mailboxes, what if docking stations were a part of standard life? Cutting out the time it takes for inspectors to get out in the field, getting accurate estimates of property YOU own, creating visualizations with a homeowners app in an instant. I believe this kind of change is imminent, which would allow us to take responsibility of our part in environmental sustainability.

I tried to replicate that flight path of the automated app we used in class, but I found for that specific building it wouldn’t quite work with such an intimate area. So, I created an optimal flight path to adjust to my situation. The red dots you see on the right are uncalibrated images that were excluded from the 3D model building process due to being error prone from the angle being too flat and me breaking the homogenous overlap that I had originally created.

Typically speaking with rendering 3D models, you want your RMSE to be as low as possible concerning the distribution of your tie points. Tie points are common visual features like corners, edges, or texture features that standout to Drone2Map that it can recognize and make a tie point at. The higher number of tie points you have the better your image is going to look, but it comes with the drawback of more storage, more data, and more time till completion. After the tie points are created you get solution points which are essentially those tie points bundled and adjusted (adjusted meaning camera orientation, angle, position, etc.…). My processing time originally was a lot longer after I got errors in my bottom few pictures, so instead of rendering the model with all 176 image I cut out about 10 to relieve those errors and complete the run time. The graph on the right is essentially a cross-match map that displays similar information to the graph on the left, showing tie points and their intersections.

I thought that this was a fabulous looking model and a great output for what this project is trying to accomplish. Now that we live in this digital world, receiving your mail by car and mailbox is outdated anyway, correct? Imagine converting that wasted space into docking stations for all houses in neighborhood to get accurate assessments of structural damage. If that gets too expensive, imagine each neighborhood having its own designated drone to fly around and collect all sorts of vegetation health data, roof structure, wall integrity reports, and any other information under the sun that can be gathered by UAS to save the environment. Battery operated machinery that is cost effective in the long run and can accomplish a plethora of tasks to save us from destroying the Earth sounds like a win to me.

I later discovered on my trip that archaeologists had used drones with imaging capabilities to assess damage over time done to Macchu Picchu. So I'm making an effort to go in the Remote Sensing direction with respect to the Vilcanota mountains. Although my final decision hasn't been finalized, with the help of my 3D Data Capture / LiDAR class, I hope to be able to narrow my scope soon.
More to be added as it develops...\
