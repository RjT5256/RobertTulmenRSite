title: "Purpose"
---

If you're like me, you were born in the United States, but don't quite feel like you're at home.

Every chance I get I make an attempt to travel to places I've never seen before. Whether its backpacking through Europe with a buddy of mine, visiting my parents in Portugal, or going North to Canada to stop by for Christmas with my Oma, I'm always looking for a new adventure. Recently, after completing my second semester at UTD I had the idea to visit my study area for one of my final projects for my advanced GIS class. I booked a flight and found myself roaming the streets of Cusco Peru and had started my two week solo adventure in South America. My goal was to experience a different culture as well as try and grab relevant data with my DJI Mini 3 Pro for potential thesis data (Peru have very strict drone laws...), but ultimately I was there to feel small again. After visiting many different cities and historical sites I finally found myself at the biggest attraction, Macchu Picchu. At only 24 I had reached one of the World's wonders and had the chance to explore this ancient relic of time, and also came to the conclusion that there's so much more to see in this World than just Texas. I want to use the knowledge I'm accumulating from this masters and put it into practice all over the world...
